This website is based on flask and some bootstrap implementation for navigation bars. Since I wanted to do a project that I could continuously work on after the project submission for practice, I tried to make it to my likes. This website accepts creation of posts, viewing other people's posts and mine, updating existing posts, and deleting posts. The update and delete button can be found once clicking on the title of the post, obviously if you are the original author.
